## Architectural Concept

Incoming restful requests are directly met by the Gateway (Reverse Proxy) and directed to the running container. The application is designed as a 3 layer architecture. Repository Design Pattern was preferred for database communication in the project. The Unit Of Work design pattern is preferred for processing incoming web service requests and minimizing code repetition. Entity Framework Core and Code First are used on the ORM side. PostgreSQL is preferred for database. The project has been implemented as stateless in microservice architecture. In this way, it can be run on Docker.

**ReadingIsGood.Gateway.API:** Reverse proxy. Responsible for receiving incoming requests and initial verification.

**ReadingIsGood.Authorization.API:** Identification service. Allows users to login.

**ReadingIsGood.Customer.API**: Service responsible for customer-related work.

**ReadingIsGood.Log.API:** It serves changes made to the database. It is used for audit log.

**ReadingIsGood.Order.API:** Used to manage orders.

## Getting Started

First of all, the application is deployed using Heroku and ElephantSQL. Access to the Swagger OpenAPI is enabled at https://ercin-readingisgood.herokuapp.com/swagger/index.html.

NET Core 5 SDK is required to compile the application. If you want to migrate to a different database than I use, you can get a free PostgreSQL database from ElephantSQL or use your own instance.
